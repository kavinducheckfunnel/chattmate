Shared usage-metering helpers for hosted-model features (FAQ generation, AI
ticket investigations). Whether a run counts against the org's message budget,
and how many credits remain, is the same question for every hosted-model
feature — kept here so each feature doesn't reimplement (or drift from) it.

OSS/self-hosted builds have no enterprise module: nothing is metered and
nothing is blocked (fail open).
