Generic plan-feature gating.

Two sources of truth, chosen by which one is present:

  * Enterprise module installed (the vendor's cloud): a feature is available
    when the org has an accessible subscription whose plan carries the flag.

  * Otherwise: the plan catalog in this repository — `plan_features` with
    per-tenant exceptions in `organization_feature_overrides`, resolved by
    app/services/features.py. This is what the operator console edits, and
    wiring it here is what makes that console's feature matrix mean something.
    Before this, the open-source path returned True unconditionally and every
    toggle in the product was decoration.

A plan nobody has configured is unrestricted rather than empty — see
app/services/features.py for why that direction is the safe one.

This generalizes the per-feature gates copied across the API layer
(lead_capture, mcp_tool, workflow, ...) — new features should gate through here
instead of minting another copy.
